# Derivative-Calculator
In progress: Building a basic derivative calculator using python.
The framework will be to:
1. parsing mechanism to process a given expression.
2. Convert it into postfix expression and tree for easy manipulation
3. Calculate derivative using tree ADT, process it to be human readable (currently the progress is at this stage)
4. Convert the derivative to infix expression.
5. Output the expression.
6. Use Tkinter to also graph the initial and derivative's expressions.
